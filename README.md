# ScatterPlot
Simple Flak and React Application to Upload a CSV and display the Scattershot diagram 

To run a Flask server on port 5000 and a React app on port 3000, follow these steps:

Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies for the Flask server by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
Install the necessary dependencies for the React app by navigating to the client directory and running npm install in your terminal.
Open two terminal windows, one for the Flask server and one for the React app.
In the first terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run export FLASK_APP=app.py to set the Flask app file.
Then run flask run to start the Flask server on port 5000.
In the second terminal window, navigate to the client directory and run npm start to start the React app on port 3000.
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the React app. The app should communicate with the Flask server running on http://localhost:5000 to upload the data and display the scatter plot.
